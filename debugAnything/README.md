> What is Debugging?

===========================================

- ``Debugging`` is the process of following a pattern to quickly and effectively resolve a bug in a system.
- ``A bug`` is like a **virus**, its sole purpose is to attack and stop a programme from functioning properly.

Being able to ``debug`` and thing, therefore means having the right processes to find the **source** of a bug in a code base and correcting the bug to allow a programme to function effectively in any language.

> Debugging is a **great** skill to have and in fact, I was once told that ``all great programmers are great debuggers``, which I didn't quite understand till I joined Makers.

During my time at Makers, I have realised that being able to debug an application is a skill on its own and it comes from the ability to

- Understand what is going on in a code base.
- Know the debugging tools for a particular language.
- Follow good programming principles and processes when crafting an application.

Thanks to The Lovely Coaches At Makers I came to understand that there are ``two`` main processes that one can following when debugging and they are
- **Getting visibility**
  - This means finding ways to see what exactly is happening within the application at various points.
  When something is not working as expected, it’s easy to assume that everything is broken. Taking the time to get visibility will ensure that base on the ``stack trace`` will ensure that the right place where the error occurred is found. This helps to gain a clear understanding of the problem and create a clear picture of its edges.

  > Tools I use to get visibility when working on an application includes ``chrome console``, ``IRB``, ``postman`` and ``ipython``.

- **Tighten the loop**
  - This is the ability to narrow down a problem after gaining visibility on it to find out the exact moment an unexpected behaviour occurred. In the process of doing this, it because clear the list of elements that were causing the bug. Even though it might seem like these first steps are pointless because the problem is “obvious,” often jumping into solving the problem too soon can lead to wasted time and effort, and to a partial or non-optimal solution.
