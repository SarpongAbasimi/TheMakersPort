  What Does It Mean By I Can Program Fluently.
</h1>

To understand and answer this question, I asked myself a simple question.

> What does it mean to be fluent in ``Twi``  Sarpong ? ``Twi is my native language ``.

This led me to define fluency in a programming language as being able to think, read, understand and communicate in the language without difficulty. So just like human language it means, I understand other speakers and I can correctly and concisely express myself. In a more technical term, this means I can read and understand other people's source codes and I can correctly express an algorithm in the language.

Some may define fluency in a programming language as 
- Being able to think in the language without having to concentrate on what you are about to do.  
- Code flowing from a person's fingertips like he or she is speaking in his or her native tongue.  
- Being able to not only think about a language but also dream about the language. 

Whiles this is true, I also agree with coaches at ``Markers`` on the subject of learning the process and best practices. This is because when a person understands the process and logic behind a language like ``Ruby``,  the same logic and process can be applied to other languages like ``javaScript ``, ``Kotlin ``, ``python`` etc.  This is because the processes are the same and the only difference is the syntax.

A good example is in week two at makers when we started learning about ``test doubles`` in ``RSpec``  and what they were. The concept of double was very confusing to me but when I finally understood it, I was able to apply the same logic and understand how to use ``spy`` in  ``jasmine``  without any difficulty. 

To prove to myself that I can program fluently and learn any language because `` I Am A Self Directiive Learner ``, I worked on these projects. 

- [Airport Challenge](https://github.com/SarpongAbasimi/AirportChallengeJs). ``JavaScript``.
  - This was the first-weekend challenge I did at Makers and it took me 2 days to complete this challenge. In week 5 at makers, I tried to solve this kata again using a new stack ``javaScript``, but this time around, I was able to complete the challenge in half a day.

  - [Bowling Challenge](https://github.com/SarpongAbasimi/bowling-challenge). ``JavaScript``.
  Having completed this Kata in JavaScript I decided to try and complete this kata in Python. To my surprise, the logic was the same the only difference was the syntax. I was able to then look up the syntax, because I knew what to look for, and work towards completing this kata.[Python Version](https://github.com/SarpongAbasimi/BowlingScoreCardPython)

  - [Thermostat Application](https://github.com/SarpongAbasimi/ThermostatJs).
  I was even surprised at myself that I was able to build this application and make it very interactive. It was during this week that I said that Makers Academy has cast a spell on me because I couldn't believe what I was capable of doing. This challenge was solved with 100% test coverage.

  - [New Sumary APP](https://github.com/SarpongAbasimi/NewsSummaryApp).
  To push myself even further, I decided to use ``React Js `` for one of the ``weekend challenges `` at Makers. I couldn't believe that in just a day, I was able to build a ``news summary App``, fully tested with ``cypress`` which works perfectly.

=============
The other side of progamming fluently, is the ability to translate human language such as specification or user stories into code and to write code using the best practices such as Test Driven Development, Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself, and Single Responsibility. In other words, keep in mind the person that may use your user interface as a user and your code as a software developer.

Having faced different challenges at Makers for setting up ``Travis `` to ``Database setup`` to ``Making a facebook clone `` and ``paring with different people everyday ``, I have learnt how to approach programming challenges, ``craft programmes`` and on top of all ``work in a team ``and contribute to the ``success of my team``. This why I say that I can programme fluently.

> Fluency means you can write code using its core capabilities without having to turn to a manual constantly to look things up.  You use the common constructs and patterns of the language as second-nature without conscious thought.  You can visualize the code you plan to write in your head.  That you're only turning to Google, documentation and the like when you are looking to use a new or advanced concept.  That you know what and where to look to find a new feature or framework without having to ask "Can I do this?".[source](https://www.quora.com/What-does-it-mean-to-be-fluent-in-a-programming-language-like-Java)
